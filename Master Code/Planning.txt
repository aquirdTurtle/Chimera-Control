### MASTER TODO: ###

Main Features
 - Create / Run / Test Atoms Experiments
    - Trap Frequency Measurement
      - Axial
      - Radial
    - Trap Depth Measurement
	- Pushout
!- Implement Scripting for the Agilent controls
 - Convert input in edit to actual dac value based on discretization
 - things associated with pre-calculating every variation
	- 1st Step: Make it calculate all sets of commands before running anything.
	- make randomize the repetition between variations an option.
	- fix "total experiment time" calculation to be accurate when a time is varying between variations.
 - handle 0 variations for variables better. If more than one range, you should be able to set a number for a range
	to be zero, but there always needs to be at least one variable. I might need to write special handling in the key
	for zero variations in one range as well.
 - implement the nice throw handler.

Bugs
- If experiment doesn't exist in correct location, and cancel, code crashes.
	- Can't repeat on laptop. Only happened once.
- Saving adds boxes to experiment notes... Perhaps related to line endings.
	- Can't repeat on laptop??? Might be related to xp.
- Be able to manually set limits on dac values in the code.
- fix opening message. queries just aren't working in general.
- prompt to save at end doesn't recognize if parent script is selected or not?
- DAC behavior is inconsistent... T.T
- not catching variable usage on dac events...
- Script is getting set as unsaved when still saved.
- Sequence not updating... not sure if this is even active in any sense but if not I should de-activate it.
- fix repetitions setting
- fix the extra DAC triggers being set
- system doesn't unshade ttls on errors...

Other Changes
- Update TTL dialog procedure to MFC
- update other dialog procedures to MFC
