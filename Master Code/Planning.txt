### MASTER TODO: ###

Main Features
 - Create / Run / Test Atoms Experiments
    - Trap Frequency Measurement
      - Axial
      - Radial
    - Trap Depth Measurement
	- Pushout
!- Implement Scripting for the Agilent controls
 - Convert input in edit to actual dac value based on discretization
 - things associated with pre-calculating every variation
	- 1st Step: Make it calculate all sets of commands before running anything.
	- make randomize the repetition between variations an option.
	- fix "total experiment time" calculation to be accurate when a time is varying between variations.
 - handle 0 variations for variables better. If more than one range, you should be able to set a number for a range
	to be zero, but there always needs to be at least one variable. I might need to write special handling in the key
	for zero variations in one range as well.
 - implement the nice throw handler.

Bugs
- If experiment doesn't exist in correct location, and cancel, code crashes.
	- Can't repeat on laptop. Only happened once.
- Saving adds boxes to experiment notes... Perhaps related to line endings.
	- Can't repeat on laptop??? Might be related to xp.
- Be able to manually set limits on dac values in the code.
- fix opening message. queries just aren't working in general.
- prompt to save at end doesn't recognize if parent script is selected or not?
- DAC behavior is inconsistent... T.T
- not catching variable usage on dac events...
- Script is getting set as unsaved when still saved.
- Sequence not updating... not sure if this is even active in any sense but if not I should de-activate it.
- fix repetitions setting
- fix the extra DAC triggers being set
- system doesn't unshade ttls on errors...

Other Changes
- Update TTL dialog procedure to MFC

### Finished ###

Features
- created rudimentary default script.
- check save before exit
- When setting parameter for variable, the variable name appears in the dialog so that the user can be sure that 
	they are setting the right thing.
- "New function" script menu option allows writing a new function without losing a parent script.
- keeps track of the function call stack throughout functions.
- always triggers oscilloscope at end of experiment. this also takes care of the issue where times added at the end 
	didn't do anything because there weren't any ttl events associated with the new time.
- Now greys out certain controls when experiment/category/config has yet to be selected.
- repetitions is now just a label and an edit.
- Handling repetition updates better as a seperate control.
- Real PGC Cooling has now been tested.
- hotkey for pause.
- Make "active" and "inactive" global variables
	- make it possible to run through the analysis routine without running experiment to see what variables are active.
	- Add custom colorings for different states
	https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/79/Neat-Stuff-to-Do-in-List-Controls-Using-Custom-Dra	
- outputs debug info to text file.
- Now makes use of the "Solarized" Syntax coloring scheme.
- Loading Atoms & Imaging them has been tested
- MOT field scans & MOT Fill time scans now tested
- Dac Dialog has been updated to MFC
- "Quiet" mode which outputs less to the main status.
- t is now white (color coding)
- randomizing the variation order is now an option
- Better warning handling, especially for the dacramp warnings.
- Now supports math in scripts
	- math with variables
	- update color coding
 - Catches negative times.
 - Be able to set whether boundaries on variable ranges are inclusive or exclusive.

Bugs
- Enter doesn't crash program
- After prompt to save script before starting, selecting "cancel" doesn't cancel.
- After "Rename config", the config name is set to blank.
- make sure local variables can over-write globals if you need to scan a global variable.
- warning if the user save a function as a .mscript.
- On New script, the combo automatically switches to parent.
- fixed bug where crashed if no dac events because trying to set final dac values.
- Fixed crashing on F1 due to not setting repControl during turnonmot calling procedure.
- filename text for script changed to normal text from heading.
- Fixed dacramp rounding & final data point issues
- Fixed Configs needing re-saving after just opening program and closing.
- Eating zeros better in dac controls.
- fixed showing "repetition..." after unpause.
- Fixed fractional time bug
- found temporary solution to dac timing issue: more dense dac ramps.
- New Tektronics generators control, allows more freedom in setting tektronics stuffs.
- With new controls, tek generators are off by default as they should be.
- eat zeros in variable values
- fixed repetition setting bug
- All ttls and dacs are now disabled during experiment
