### MASTER TODO: ###

Main Features
- Test Output Functionality
  - Run MOT Experiments
    - MOT Temperature Measurement
    - PGC Temperature Measurement
  - Create / Run / Test Atoms Experiments
	- Load Atoms & Image
    - Trap Frequency Measurement
      - Axial
      - Radial
    - Trap Depth Measurement
	- Pushout
    - etc....
- Scripting for the Agilent controls
- Option to see the startup message after startup
- Convert input in edit to actual dac value based on discretization
- Be able to manually set limits on dac values in the code.
- make randomizing the variation order an option
- make randomize the repetition between variations an option.
- Grey out controls when experiment/category/config has yet to be selected.
	- Controls that should be sensitive:
		- Comments (all levels)
		- higher level combos (e.g. config should be grey if category hasn't been set)
		- Config variables
- Be able to have a scroll-bar when window shrinks instead of re-sizing everything.
- change repetitions to just be a label and an edit.
- Handle repetition updates better... perhaps just a seperate control.
- More options for programming textronics generators.
- make the color coding better.
- Make "active" and "inactive" global variables
	- make it possible to run through the analysis routine without running experiment to see what variables are active.
	- Add custom colorings for different states

- When setting parameter for variable, the variable name should appear in the dialog so that the user can be sure that 
	they are setting the right thing.
- check save before exit

Bugs
- Header text size too large / boxes too small on master comp
- On New script, the combo should automatically switch to parent? or something. Should not stay.
- If the last command is a time command, the code doesn't realize it needs to wait extra long or anything.
- get the default master script uploaded
- hanlde 0 variations for variables better. If more than one range, you should be able to set a number for a range
	to be zero, but there always needs to be at least one variable. I might need to write special handling in the key
	for zero variations in one range as well.
- fix "total experiment time" calculation to be accurate when a time is varying between variations.
- after new script & saving function, script name appears to be lost. is probably
  lost at "new script", so I should probably have something like a "new function" 
  option that preserves the parent script so that it's easy to go back?
- Tektronix generators should be turned off by default. Right now if you run a config without them they turn on.
- make sure local variables can over-write globals if you need to scan a global variable.
- After "Rename config", the config name is set to blank.
- Enter shouldn't crash program
- If experiment doesn't exist in correct location, and cancel, code crashes.
- After prompt to save script before starting, selecting "cancel" doesn't cancel.
- Saving adds boxes to experiment notes... Perhaps related to line endings.
- Bug where code doesn't appear to be doing anything after 2-deep function call???
- don't let the user save a function as a .mscript.
