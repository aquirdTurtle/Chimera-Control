What is VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture)?
VISA is a standardized I/O API for communicating with test and measurement devices, such as our waveform generators,
oscilloscopes. It is very general, and has been implemented over a variety of serialized (like USB) and parallel 
(like GPIB) communication busses.  It typically makes use of the "Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments" 
syntax.

A couple key intro paragraphs from the VISA wiki:

"Virtual instrument software architecture, commonly known as VISA, is a widely used I/O API in the test and measurement 
(T&M) industry for communicating with instruments from a computer. VISA is an industry standard implemented by several 
T&M companies, such as, Anritsu, Bustec, Keysight Technologies, Kikusui, National Instruments, Rohde & Schwarz, 
and Tektronix."

"The VISA library has standardized the presentation of its operations over several software reuse mechanisms, including
through a C API exposed from Windows DLL, visa32.dll, over the Microsoft COM technology, and through a .NET API. 
Although there are several VISA vendors and implementations, applications written against VISA are (nominally) 
vendor-interchangeable thanks to the standardization of VISA's presentation and operations/capabilities. 
Implementations from specific vendors[specify] are also available for less common programming languages[specify] and 
software reuse technologies."

// this is my wrapper around the visa protocol. There are two types of visa on my system, "NI"-Visa and "Keysight"-Visa.
// These in principle are to be used for different, but I believe that this is all low level stuff under the hood.
