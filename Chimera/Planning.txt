CODE PLANNING
===================
FEATURES:
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. Requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
		- also gets tricky if diff sequences use instruments differently.
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support variables for agilent scripts
- proper syntax coloring for variables
- implement real-time sanity check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in plots
- improve experiment status; include which config was run, variable options
- report oscilloscope data to datalogger
- report initial values of dacs and ttls to datalogger
- report andor background data to datalogger if calibrating background out
- improve delete file after abort functionality
	- decorate name, delete after a while.
- Integrate the Andor and Basler cameras into the experimentThreadProcedure to enable calibrations, etc. between 
	variations.
- add reporting on how many atoms loaded via atomcruncher thread.
	- accessible from main window, perhaps
	- report to h5 file as well
- prompt for load after saving config as
- improve delete file after abort functionality
	- decorate name and (maybe) delete after a while, or just decorate...
- Improve auto-optimization
	- Implement different algorithms...
		- basin-hopping
 		- Randomized Search
 		- Neural Network
		- Genetic / evolutionary
	- End when converged
	- make finishing of optimization smoother
	- option to text when optimization finished. 
- Implement smarter thresholding?
	- Have code run python script which makes use of my auto-finding of the gaussian thresholds at the end of a run.
	  Especially useful for auto-optimization to keep this good over time.
- Make (option for) hist plots for single pic mode andor images
- include calibration data in dac and servos
- be able to query current connection status like what shows up in the beginning
- some way of making niawg scripts with many tones more compact. something with arrays.
- make plot update rate be changeable in real-time to help deal with slowness in long runs.

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo in real time plotting
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- Andor system should use Matrix class for pictures, like basler.
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency
- refactor diosystem to use dioRows for row names (A, B, C, D)
- reduce size of niawgcontroller file somehow, it's ungainly huge.
- refactor commonfunctions, it's a bit of a mess. 
- Make config parameter system aware of whether it is giving a constant or variable run so that the range stuff can be 
	accurate.
- refactor rerngmove complexmove and simplemove names which are confusing... 
- refactor master configuration to be more similar to normal configuration reading
- Label all values in config file, making it very human-readable.
- Use new slider controls
- reorganize .h and .cpp files in visual studio
- remove the complicated rearrangement that happens on the camera window, all functions available at all times.
- reconsider how to handle initial dac and ttl values

Checks and Tests
- add check for flash that sum of indv move times is the total move time.
- check niawg script for multiple repeat forevers or commands outside a repeat forever.
- test niawg script reading for different inputs that should be identical, related to ramps with nr for example.

BUGS:
- fix save function to not need alt-sau but automatically working.
- Fix always prompt for overwrite function
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global variable colors don't appear to always be correct; agilent variable issue probably?
- interpret key taking a long time for ttls in camera cal for some reason.
- seems like master configuration file can get corrupted if saving fails.
- going from config with video to kinetic mode on andor fails because internal reps per var is too high
- if taking pictures too fast code can freeze while pics getting handled.
- something funny about going back and forth between video and kinetic modes (and the size of controls?)
- Should only require calibration files if F5, not if only camera starts e.g.
- err boxes don't grab focus of entire program
- something in the thrower system is eating the last character of the error message.
- should not be able to load agilent script if not in scripting mode.
- servos failing quietly...
- should be able to change basler image dimensions edits while running
- basler fails silently sometimes if issues with binning or dims
- constant beeping if no mot and continuous freezes things basler
