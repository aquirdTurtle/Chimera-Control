TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- Implementations of local variables
	- The idea:
		- use var to define local variables and give them a default value.
			- e.g. var rightField = 0
		- Either modify config or global vars control, or add new vars control which has a function combo to select which
			function (or parent script) to look at.
		- cannot modify constant value in this view, must modify value in script. Can only modify variable range values.
	- What needs to be done:
		- need to modify reading of script to deal with these variables. 
			- Function handling needs list of variables being varied and what function the variables belong to. 
				Only if both match should the handling replace the constant value.
		- need to add handling for new control
	- how to handle saving variable settings? could just not save at all, but saves would be good.
		- could save all function variables as they get loaded or changed in an object in the VariableSystem
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
		- also gets trick if diff sequences use instruments differently.
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support aborting while paused
- implement check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in plots

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- Andor system should use Matrix class for pictures
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency

BUGS:
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global variable colors don't appear to always be correct. Not being changed by use in agilent and niawg?
- niawg is doing something during turnonmot... it shouldn't.
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- bug in picture stats retrieval from image array? This might have been related to the bug that occured when the 
	picture was skipping. Seems to have stopped happening around the time that the skip started manifesting in the
	data itself.
- Agilent non-integer number of samples bugs don't make sense, "bad time entered for the time of an intensity sequence"
- trying save if only camera is running...
- what's happening if you try to abort in the middle of the "programming" stage?
- fix variable logging / figure out what the problem is here.
