CODE PLANNING
===================
IMMEDIATE LIST:
- fix attempts to set camera mode on config change.
- fix auto-thresholding
- local copy of save file.

FEATURES:
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- Implementing randomizing repetitions.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in real time analysis plots
- report most recent oscilloscope data to datalogger
- report andor background data to datalogger if calibrating background out
- improve delete file after abort functionality
	- decorate name, delete after a while, or something similar?
- add reporting on how many atoms loaded via atomcruncher thread.
	- accessible from main window, perhaps
	- report to h5 file as well?
- prompt for load after saving config as
- Improve auto-optimization
	- Implement different algorithms...
		- basin-hopping, Randomized Search, Neural Network, Genetic / evolutionary
	- End when converged
	- make finishing of optimization smoother
	- option to text when optimization finished. 
- Make (option for) hist plots for single pic mode andor images
- make plot update rate be changeable in real-time to help deal with slowness in long runs.
- make data analysis plotting listview smart about # of pictures
- some sort of more real-time adjustment of parameters, need some sort of looping around starting configs... or some other solution

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on condition_variables
- refactor groups in plotinfo in real time plotting
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- reduce size of niawgcontroller file somehow, it's ungainly huge.
- Make config parameter system aware of whether it is giving a constant or variable run so that the range stuff can be 
	accurate.
- refactor rerngmove complexmove and simplemove names which are confusing... 
- remove the complicated rearrangement that happens on the camera window, all functions available at all times, 
	perhaps just grey'd out
- seems that there's still auto fitting stuff in the data analysis but I don't think this is supported anymore?
- either only put the "overwriting function definition" when actually uses the save or remove this

Checks and Tests
	- add check for flash that sum of indv move times is the total move time.
- Check for and warn about jumps in tweezer intensity
- check niawg script for multiple repeat forevers or commands outside a repeat forever.
- test niawg script reading for different inputs that should be identical, related to ramps with nr for example.
- implement real-time sanity check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- check number of basler triggers against basler total picture number

BUGS:
- going from config with video to kinetic mode on andor fails because internal reps per var is too high
- if taking pictures too fast code can freeze while pics getting handled.
- err boxes don't grab focus of entire program - annoying to fix...
- should be able to change basler image dimensions edits while running
- constant beeping if no mot and continuous freezes things basler
- figure out why figure update seems to cause main thread window thread to freak out
- ttl display not accurate at end of exp, and in general not always accurate... e.g. on startup.  should query board 
  for status.
