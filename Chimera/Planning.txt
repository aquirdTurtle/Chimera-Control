===================
TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- feedback on atom number at end of experiment.
	- create atomic (?) int which stores the number of atoms in the last picture of most recent run
	- have atom cruncher update this number, have the master thread read the number to determine how to program 
		machines.
- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- revive sequences of experiments
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- Watch cursor location on andor pictures, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- if fails to open script file give user opportunity to find it themselves.
- make agilent smart about trying to program a sequence that's only one voltage. Can prob just add one check
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots
- support aborting while paused
- check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- more tooltips
- option to open the config file (for inspection) if fails to open on open config.
Refactoring / Other:
- change thread that wait on bools to waiting on signalers
- test running avg gnuplot
- test fitting in gnuplot
- refactor groups in plotinfo and gnuplot stuffs
Bugs:
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- investigate save on change config
- global config colors don't appear to always be correct.
