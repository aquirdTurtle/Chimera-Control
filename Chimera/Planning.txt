===================
TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- revive sequences of experiments
	- Full experiments following each other
- consider implementations of local variables
	- using var or similar keyword to define local variables in functions or main script.
	- code scans currently used functions for local variables used and just lists those
	- use combo to list just variables in a function or all variables
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots?
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps.
- Implement Histogram mfc plot
- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- Watch cursor location on andor pictures, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support aborting while paused
- implement check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another. ???
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo and gnuplot stuffs
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- remove intensity from color boxes
- should only have one window showing you info before start of run.
- more tooltips

Bugs:
- something wrong with set New dac Values! Pressing seems to change whether shutter is open or closed???
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global config colors don't appear to always be correct. Not being changed by use in agilent and niawg?
- fix over-writing to the agilent.
- niawg is doing something during turnonmot
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- bug in picture stats retrieval from image array? Seems like might have been not really the fault of the image stats, 
	but should look into this a bit.
- Agilent non-integer number of samples bugs don't make sense

Rearranging
- code for creating non-flashing moves
- code for creating parallel moves
- code for managing moves
- utilize non-flashing moves
- utilize compound flashing moves
