===================
TODO
===================

Features:
- Display Actual kinetic Cycle Time
- Display Minimum kinetic cycle time
- finish implementing 2D scans
- Implement Chris's Plots of ttls and dacs

- could clean up textpromptdialog handling, should be possible with one line.
- Improve frame rate?
	- should be able to get 3.12 frames / sec or so at full array size
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- Watch cursor location, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- option to allow agilent waveforms to function with or without calibration
- make a structure and a front panel option for agilent calibrations
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- if fails to open script file give user opportunity to find it themselves.
- default script for agilent with command guide?
- gnuplot safemode? (not sure needed at all).
- handle niawg waiting more elegantly
- make the big text short status messages better.
- be able to program agilents with or without power->volt conversion. Think I just want a combo.
- indicate setting (no, off, dc, sine, square, pre, script) next to agilent channel text
- make agilent smart about trying to program a sequence that's only one voltage. Can prob just add one check
- support math in niawg and intensity scripts
- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- Be able to turn off / on NIAWG without stopping program
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
- Finish implementing agilent channel sync.
- handle config not opening better
	- option to find config file?
	- option to create new default config file with that name?
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots
- Add camera region "Center" and save offsets of the borders from the center to config files.
- Be able to scroll into empty space at bottom of scripts

Refactoring / Other:
- refactor variables & variable key so that they aren't two separate objects. Consider if reasonable to also include 
	variation number.
- change niawg commands to be one word

Bugs:
- restart niawg freezes program? // should not be an issue after dealing with clean exiting of master thread.
- number of camera pictures not getting set by config.
- dacramp spacing warning should only appear once, and should appear in error status?
- after abort should stop fully before prompting to delete files.
- scripts not always getting saved with proper extension? Not sure how to repeat yet.
- handle aborting when paused
- Add new data set not working in plot designer
- Editing and re-saving plot files doesn't delete the old file if the filename changed.
- Weird trouble with 2-picture plotting
- Titles for scripts aren't correct
- machnie script gets outputted with extra "end script"
- Thresholds not getting set properly
- Fix top / bottom name mismatch
- commands with spaces after them get eaten wrong. probably a result of using getline, but if I'm using scriptstream, 
	scriptstream should probably be able to eat whitespace on the end of the line.
- dacs occaisonally breaking on config load.
- parentscript not working?
- something going wrong with exiting the niawg normally. Might be on delete waveforms, might be related to change from 
	having orientations
