TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
		- also gets trick if diff sequences use instruments differently.
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support variables for agilent scripts
- proper syntax coloring for variables
- implement real-time sanity check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in plots
- improve experiment status; include which config was run, variable options
- check niawg script for multiple repeat forevers or commands outside a repeat forever.
- output more timing info on the programming process
- have code work with temperature monitoring
- report oscilloscope data to datalogger
- report andor background data to datalogger
- improve delete file after abort functionality
- Integrate the camera into the experimentThreadProcedure to enable calibrations, etc. between variations.
- auto mot calibration runs
- add reporting on how many atoms loaded via atomcruncher thread.
- improve delete file after abort functionality
- option for rearranging: no flashing and no static array for extra potential rearranging.
- add reporting on how many atoms loaded via atomcruncher thread.
- improve delete file after abort functionality
- integrate a basler window.
	- involve config info...

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- Andor system should use Matrix class for pictures
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency
- refactor the way agilents get programmed; pull analyze agilent script earlier to sequence
- refactor dacs to have all info about a dac organized into a dac object (name, minmax, default val, notes, etc.)
- reduce size of niawgcontroller file; maybe try to separate out rearrange functionality?

BUGS:
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global variable colors don't appear to always be correct; agilent issue probably?
- Turnonmot should really be the minimal stuff
	- niawg is doing something during turnonmot... it shouldn't.
	- turnonmot seems to be running tektronics stuff too.
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- Agilent non-integer number of samples bugs don't make sense, "bad time entered for the time of an intensity sequence"
- trying save if only camera is running...
- in rearranging, add check that source matrix is larger than target.
- crash when change color scheme during experiment???
- make eating comments more robust against eol conversion issues.
- interpret key taking a long time for ttls in camera cal
- seems like master configuration file can get corrupted if saving fails.
