===================
TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- revive sequences of experiments
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps.
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots

- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- Watch cursor location on andor pictures, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support aborting while paused
- check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- more tooltips
- catch and warn about attemtps to save script when agilent isn't in scripting mode
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?

Refactoring / Other:
- change thread that wait on bools to waiting on signalers
- test running avg gnuplot
- test fitting in gnuplot
- refactor groups in plotinfo and gnuplot stuffs
- change plotting to have fixed x-axis size.
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- remove intensity from color boxes

Bugs:
- something wrong with set New dac Values! Pressing seems to change whether shutter is open or closed???
- exposure time setting properly for andor camera? (maybe just prob in video mode)

- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- investigate save on change config
- global config colors don't appear to always be correct. (not sure how to repeat yet)
- fix over-writing to the agilent.
- niawg is doing something during turnonmot

Rearranging
- smartly figure out where to rearrange to and move at the end to center
- utilize compound moves
