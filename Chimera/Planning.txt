===================
TODO
===================

Features:
- finish implementing 2D scans
- Remove three-stage config file system

- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- Watch cursor location, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- if fails to open script file give user opportunity to find it themselves.
- handle niawg waiting more elegantly
- make the big text short status messages better.
- be able to program agilents with or without power->volt conversion. Think I just want a combo.
- indicate setting (no, off, dc, sine, square, pre, script) next to agilent channel text
- make agilent smart about trying to program a sequence that's only one voltage. Can prob just add one check
- support math in niawg and intensity scripts
- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- Be able to turn off / on NIAWG without stopping program
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
- Finish implementing agilent channel sync.
- handle config not opening better
	- option to find config file?
	- option to create new default config file with that name?
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots
- Be able to scroll into empty space at bottom of scripts
- be able to output niawg waveforms to text files
- support aborting while paused
- be able to set binsize for histograms
- change colormap radios to a single combo.
- load colormaps from file, allowing custom colormaps.
- initialize windows to certain monitor
- make count-down use TTL time
- check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- cross-check number of NIAWG triggers, numb	er of Agilent triggers in code
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.

Refactoring / Other:
- refactor variables & variable key so that they aren't two separate objects. Consider if reasonable to also include 
	variation number in a class
- change thread that wait on bools to waiting on signalers
- could clean up textpromptdialog handling, should be possible with one line.
- test running avg gnuplot
- test fitting in gnuplot
- refactor groups in plotinfo and gnuplot stuffs

Bugs:
- Add new data set not working in plot designer
- closing window doesn't stop program, running in background (release mode only?)
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- investigate save on change config
- New Experiment doesn't copy everything in folder
