===================
TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
		- also gets trick if diff sequences use instruments differently.
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support aborting while paused
- implement check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in plots

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- Andor system should use Matrix class for pictures
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency
- specialize CEdit with "getTextAsDouble" member.
- make version check function for reading config files.

BUGS:
- Catch if variable has only 1 variation, not well defined.
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global variable colors don't appear to always be correct. Not being changed by use in agilent and niawg?
- niawg is doing something during turnonmot... it shouldn't.
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- bug in picture stats retrieval from image array? This might have been related to the bug that occured when the 
	picture was skipping. Seems to have stopped happening around the time that the skip started manifesting in the
	data itself.
- Agilent non-integer number of samples bugs don't make sense, "bad time entered for the time of an intensity sequence"
- trying save if only camera is running...
- fix variable logging / figure out what the problem is here.
- turnonmot seems to be running tektronics stuff too
- figure out "parent script" not loading bug
