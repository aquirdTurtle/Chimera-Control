===================
TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
		- also gets tricky if diff sequences use instruments differently.
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support variables for agilent scripts
- proper syntax coloring for variables
- implement real-time sanity check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- restore ability to look multi-pixel conditions / events in plots
- improve experiment status; include which config was run, variable options
- check niawg script for multiple repeat forevers or commands outside a repeat forever.
- output more timing info on the programming process
- report oscilloscope data to datalogger
- report andor background data to datalogger
- improve delete file after abort functionality
	- decorate name, delete after a while.
- Integrate the Andor and Basler cameras into the experimentThreadProcedure to enable calibrations, etc. between 
	variations.
- add reporting on how many atoms loaded via atomcruncher thread.
	- accessible from main window, perhaps
	- report to h5 file as well
- Improve comments on what units everything should be in at every moment.
- prompt for load after saving config as
- improve delete file after abort functionality
- Improve auto-optimization
	- Implement different algorithms
		- basin-hopping
 		- Randomized Search
 		- Neural Network
		- Genetic / evolutionary
	- End when converged
	- make finishing of optimization smoother
	- option to text when optimization finished. 
- Implement smarter thresholding?
	- Have code run python script which makes use of my auto-finding of the gaussian thresholds at the end of a run.
	  Especially useful for auto-optimization to keep this good over time.
- Make the code able to check if the mot is there.
- Make (option for?) plots for single pic mode andor images
- display threshold on histogram.
- more tests
- use custom (bigger) dialog for err, info boxes.
- consider using sine lookup tables for niawg calculations.

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- Andor system should use Matrix class for pictures, like basler.
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency
- refactor the way agilents get programmed; pull analyze agilent script earlier to sequence
- refactor dacs to have all info about a dac organized into a dac object (name, minmax, default val, notes, etc.)
- refactor diosystem to use dioRows for row names (A, B, C, D)
- reduce size of niawgcontroller file somehow, it's ungainly huge.
- refactor commonfunctions, it's a bit of a mess. 
- Make config parameter system aware of whether it is giving a constant or variable run so that the range stuff can be accurate.
- make messages not global variables...
- refactor rerngmove complexmove and simplemove which are confusing...
- refactor niawg sampleNum member to be a function call, basically return getSampleNum(this->time);

BUGS:
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global variable colors don't appear to always be correct; agilent issue probably?
- turnonmot seems to be running tektronics stuff too.
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- trying save if only camera is running...
- in rearranging, add check that source matrix is larger than target.
- crash when change color scheme during experiment???
- make eating comments more robust against eol conversion issues.
- interpret key taking a long time for ttls in camera cal
- seems like master configuration file can get corrupted if saving fails.
- for flash check that sum of indv move times is the total move time.
- going from config with video to kinetic mode on andor fails because internal reps per var is too high
- if taking pictures too fast code freezes
- something funny about going back and forth between video and kinetic modes.
- if in video before switching configs, switching configs fails.
- start and stop while starting breaks...
- plot histogram columns overlap
- closing the wrong plot will close all...
- in debug mode aborting doesn't seem to work...
	- make the waitonsingleobject calls smarter in the aborting process.
