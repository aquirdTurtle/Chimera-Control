TODO
===================
FEATURES:
- consider implementations of local variables
	- using var or similar keyword to define local variables in functions or main script.
	- code scans currently used functions for local variables used and just lists those
	- use combo to list just variables in a function or all variables
- Full experiments following each other, alternative use of sequences.
- Be able to set different analysis locations for different plots?
- Consider ways to make navigating many functions more sensible. May be similar to local variable considerations.
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
	- Create per-repetitiong list of variation values to use
	- Be able to randomize
	- handle random case in plotting.
	- be able to add more repetitions on the fly if randomizing reps. requires some camera magic.
	- mix sequences in as well?
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- support functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- support aborting while paused
- implement check that the picture rate is matching the rep rate
- agilent script programNow with variables, should be able to set constants with program now.
- agilent should be able to go smoothly from one waveform to another.
- get running average working again
- add all agilents / tek to color boxes?
- fix last point issue with plots
- Add default close behavior
- Add option to sustain.

Refactoring / Other:
- change threads waiting on bools to waiting on signalers
- refactor groups in plotinfo and gnuplot stuffs
- change pointers to smart-ptrs where possible
- more tooltips
- better documentation in general
- remove gnuplot after finish with hists.
- Andor system should use matrix for pictures
- all mutexes should use lock_guard or similar for consistency
- remove gnuplot

BUGS:
- scripts becoming unsaved after move, should preserve saved status
- global config colors don't appear to always be correct. Not being changed by use in agilent and niawg?
- fix over-writing to the agilent. ???
- niawg is doing something during turnonmot
- control tektronics not being saved in config?
- bug in picture stats retrieval from image array? Seems like might have been not really the fault of the image stats, 
	but should look into this a bit.
- Agilent non-integer number of samples bugs don't make sense, "bad time entered for the time of anintensity sequence"
- trying save if only camera is running...
- trying to use -1 on first waveform causes crash.

Rearranging
- code for creating non-flashing moves
- code for creating parallel moves
- code for managing moves
- utilize non-flashing moves
- utilize compound flashing moves
