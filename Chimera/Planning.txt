===================
TODO
===================

Features:
- Display Actual kinetic Cycle Time
- Display Minimum kinetic cycle time
- finish implementing 2D scans
- Implement Chris's Plots of ttls and dacs

- could clean up textpromptdialog handling, should be possible with one line.
- Improve frame rate?
	- should be able to get 3.12 frames / sec or so at full array size
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of separate Hor/Vert scripts.
- Watch cursor location, sim to basler program
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform duringx the run of the previous waveform.
- option to allow agilent waveforms to function with or without calibration
- make a structure and a front panel option for agilent calibrations
- functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- if fails to open script file give user opportunity to find it themselves.
- default script for agilent with command guide?
- gnuplot safemode? (not sure needed at all).
- handle niawg waiting more elegantly
- make the big text short status messages better.
- be able to program agilents with or without power->volt conversion. Think I just want a combo.
- indicate setting (no, off, dc, sine, square, pre, script) next to agilent channel text
- make agilent smart about trying to program a sequence that's only one voltage. Can prob just add one check
- support math in niawg and intensity scripts
- if aborts or crashes in the middle of run, code should close HDF5 file and make it usable, somehow.
- Be able to turn off / on NIAWG without stopping program
- finish implementing randomizing repetitions.
- Finish implementing agilent channel sync.
- handle config not opening better
	- option to find config file?
	- option to create new default config file with that name?

Refactoring / Other:
- refactor variables & variable key so that they aren't two separate objects. Consider if reasonable to also include 
	variation number.

Bugs:
- restart niawg freezes program? // should not be an issue after dealing with clean exiting of master thread.
- number of camera pictures not getting set by config.
- dacramp spacing warning should only appear once, and should appear in error status?
- after abort should stop fully before prompting to delete files.
- scripts not always getting saved with proper extension? Not sure how to repeat yet.

=================
Finished
=================

Features:
- proper newConfiguration working with default settings for all controls.
- Scripts handle no scritp more elegantly with "None" as script address.
- Agilents handle opening parent scripts better, clearing script before opening in case the open fails.

Bugs:
- coloring of special commands in niawg updated for flashing stuffs
- brackets in niawg scripts no longer eaten
- paths for scripts are no longer too long to fit in the display
- Fixed closing of program.
- fixed debugging options controls not being selectable and stuff.
- fixed key bug when starting only camera
- better message when save fails.
- function combo works for master script again
- fix re-coloring of script after view load.
- fixed rsg coloring bug
- fixed rsg not working in function bug
- fixed rsg help being wrong
- fixed writing of rsg status to rsg info box
- fixed plotting
- fixed an issue with multi-picture plotting.
- now aborts fully upon an error, not requiring pressing esc
- Now exiting running niawg w/ master more gracefully.

Refactoring / Other:
- update colors for variables
- removed timelike option which wasn't used for anything at this time.
- removed "orientation" handling.
- refactored key location to main window. Not sure I actually need a key object like this that belongs to the windows.
- Cleaned up solution files in this branch.
- Renamed consoleApplication1 to TestConsoleApp

BEFORE BETA:
- Fix obvious serious bugs
	- new config
	- camera picture number
	- obvious stability issues
- review documentation of key parts of code
	- mainWindow
	- MainExperimentThread
