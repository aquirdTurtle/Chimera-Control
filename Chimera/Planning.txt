===================
TODO
===================

Core Requirements:

Features:
- could clean up textpromptdialog handling, should be possible with one line.
- Consider thread organization with master run thread & Niawg run Thread
- change / remove "orientation" handling.
- Display Actual kinetic Cycle Time
- Display minimum kinetic cycle time
- Improve frame rate?
	- should be able to get 3.12 frames / sec or so at full array size
- NIAWG scripting in single script instead of Hor/Vert scripts.
- Watch cursor location
- update colors for variables
- restore the Niawg functionality where it calculates next varying waveform during the run of the previous waveform.
- option to allow agilent waveforms to function with or without calibration
- make a structure and a front panel option for agilent calibrations
- functions for niawg and agilent scripts
- if fails to open script file give user opportunity to find it themselves.
- default script for agilent with command guide?
- refactor variables & variable key so that they aren't two separate objects. Consider if reasonable to also include 
	variation number.
- gnuplot safemode?
- handle niawg waiting more elegantly
- make the big text short status better.
- be able to program agilents with or without power->volt conversion. Think I just want a combo.
- indicate setting (no, off, dc, sine, square, pre, script) next to agilent channel text
- make agilent smart about trying to program a sequence that's only one voltage. Can prob just add one check
Bugs:
- restart niawg freezes program 
- close one window should close all 
- exit running niawg w/ master more gracefully.
- fix plotting
- fix variations begin zero at new variations
- number of camera pictures not getting set by config.
- dacramp spacing warning should only appear once, and should appear in error status?
- make functions combos work for master script again
- paths for scripts are too long to fit in the display
- key getting initialized in weird places
- doesn't abort fully upon an error.
- after abort should stop fully before prompting to delete files.
- some cancels break things on starting the experiment
- config setting agilent doesn't set output type correctly, just stays at prev value (e.g. no-control)
