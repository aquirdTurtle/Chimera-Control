		// version 2.11: added agilent options to calibration manager.
		// version 2.12: added more fitting options and the calibrations to the calibration manager
		// version 2.13: added raw calibration results, so should be more possible to recover results
		// Version 3.0: stopped saving servo manager info. Didn't really want to keep this backwards compatible and

		//				to allow jump to config to work with the config manager.
