def rotateFields():

	% ramping fields assuming from pump2stretch values as of 9/11/2017. if seeing funny things would need to check pump2stretch values
	% input is theta and phi, where theta=0, phi=0 represents the normal 3G field direction along left and right. here we try to keep the field constant during rotation
	% define left at theta=pi/2,phi=0; top at theta=0; front at theta=pi/2, phi=pi/2
	% according to calibrations in 2017/9/9-2017/9/11, we have individual calibrations of each coil field DAC values/22-11 resonance in V/MHz
	% left/right 0.873132/-0.85932; top/bottom -0.717172/0.780168; front/back 1.13866/-1.11831
	% null point at setting right/left +-0.4856; top/bottom +-1.994; front/back -+0.551
	% according to D Steck we have 22-11 transition of 2.1 MHz/Gauss, thus for 3G we have 6.3 MHz shift from resonance

	% devide by 2 to even out both directions
