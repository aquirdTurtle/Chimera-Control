This is the space for any basic calibrations (using single atoms) that are general enough to float between multiple science experiments. Examples: (a) Loading Atoms, (b) Trap Frequency Calibrations, (c) Trap Depth Calibrations, (d) Cooling Calibrations? (e) Microwave Calibrations, (f) Imaging calibrations, etc.
