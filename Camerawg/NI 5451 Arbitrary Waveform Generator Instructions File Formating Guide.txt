/***********************************************************************\
 NI 5451 ARBITRARY WAVEFORM GENERATOR INSTRUCTIONS FILE FORMATTING GUIDE
\***********************************************************************/


The instructions file consists of two parts. The first part is a series of settings to use when generating 
the waveform. The second part is a series of commands for the waveform, and includes commands like generating 
waveforms, generating ramping waveforms, simple logic statements, repeat statements, triggers, and markers.

In each case, if a command requires input (for example, the frequency and amplitude of a waveform), the input
format is referenced below using angled brackets <...>. Place the input on the line below the command in the 
format specified. 

Semicolons are optional.

You can use the waveform commands with or without (if you are already familiar with the format) including the 
bracketed formatting instructions as well (e.g. "gen 1 const" instead of "gen 1 const <freq> <amp> | <time>").

The ramping type options are currently "Linear" and "NoRamp".

The numbers indicated (e.g. gen /3/ consts) refer to the number of different frequencies that command can take 
as input. The other command specifies (e.g. "freq ramp") refer to the ramping options that the command is capable
of taking as input. If you want to generate 3 frequencies, and do an amplitude ramp on only one of them, then 
use "gen 3 amp ramps" command, then say "Linear" on the frequency that you want to ramp, and "NoRamp" on the
others.

The associated c++ code has been designed to be flexible when it comes to trailing white-spaces at the ends of 
lines and in between commands, so use whatever such formatting pleases your eyes. Do not, however, include extra
characters anywhere. Make sure that the command text is copied exactly, or the program will throw an error, tell
you that it doesn't recognize the inputed character, and exit without running the waveform.
